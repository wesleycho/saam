### Technical Details

#### UI

*    Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
*    Run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower` (will likely have to prefix with `sudo`)
*    In the `ui` directory, run `npm install` and then `bower install`
*    Install [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) (Wes: I recommend via [RVM](http://rvm.io))
*    In the command line, run `gem install compass modular-scale`
*    In another terminal window, navigate to `ui/app/styles` and run `compass watch ./`
*    If you want to see the page, just run `grunt server` and observe any changes automatically reflected by this browser!
